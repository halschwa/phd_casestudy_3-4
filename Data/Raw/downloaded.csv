1,Exploring the complexity of highways infrastructure programmes in the United Kingdom through systems thinking,Project Leadership and Society,Article,01-12-23,10.1016/j.plas.2023.100081,SCOPUS_ID:85151287115,2-s2.0-85151287115,"
                  In this study, we seek to conceptualise multi-dimensional impacts of infrastructure investment through case studies of three nationally significant highways programmes in England. We use system thinking principles to characterise socioeconomic and policy impacts that may emerge from the interconnectedness of system variables. We consider three ‚Äòcomplex infrastructure programmes‚Äô in the National Highways portfolio; the A303 Stonehenge Tunnel, the A66 Trans-Pennine upgrade and the Lower Thames Crossing (LTC) and illustrate the interdependencies that may be present within and between these programmes using causal models. We identify a set of commonalities between the three programmes, with indications towards potential mechanisms for facilitating economic growth in disparate regions where timely implementation of efficient policies may be achieved. Moreover, we evidence that evaluating impacts through segmented areas of focus such as social, economic and policy may not adequately portray the real impacts of infrastructure investment in a comprehensive way. This research justifies the importance of understanding infrastructure projects as interconnected, complex systems that may deliver desired benefits in a non-linear and highly emergent way. We conclude with a proposition that understanding the characteristics of the larger infrastructure system-of-systems, is crucial to unlocking added value and realising long-term benefits of highways infrastructure investment.

2,Assessing the authenticity of a sample taken from the Altar Stone at Stonehenge in 1844 using portable XRF and automated SEM-EDS,Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports,Article,01-06-23,10.1016/j.jasrep.2023.103973,SCOPUS_ID:85151458254,2-s2.0-85151458254,"
                  Megalithic Stone 80 at Stonehenge, the so-called Altar Stone, is traditionally considered to be part of the bluestone assemblage, a diverse range of lithologies exotic to the Wiltshire Landscape. However, the Altar Stone, a grey-green micaceous sandstone, is anomalous when compared with the other (predominantly igneous) bluestones, in terms of its lithology, size and weight, and certainly in terms of its provenance. Recent investigations into the character of the Altar Stone have focussed on excavated fragments now attributed to be derived from the Altar Stone, as well as non-destructive portable XRF (pXRF) analysis on the Altar Stone itself (re-analysed as part of this investigation). In this study we have investigated a sample from the collections of Salisbury Museum, 2010K 240 (also referred to as Wilts 277), which bears a label recording that it was collected from the underside of the Altar Stone in 1844. We examined the sample petrographically and also by using pXRF and automated SEM-EDS techniques. Like the excavated fragments, this sample from the Altar Stone shows a distinctive mineralogy characterised by the presence of baryte and kaolinite along with abundant calcite cement. The presence of baryte leads to relatively high Ba being recorded during pXRF analysis (0.13¬†wt%). Combined, these results validate the history recorded on the specimen label and, as far as we know, makes this the only specimen taken purposely from that megalith. As such sample 2010K 240 provides a ‚Äògo-to‚Äô proxy for future studies of the Altar Stone as well as validating those samples recently assigned to the Altar Stone. In addition, this study demonstrates the vital importance of historic collection specimens and their preservation, conservation and documentation, as well as the role pXRF can play in the analysis of sensitive cultural artefacts and monuments that cannot be analysed using invasive or destructive techniques.

                  Excavations at two of the sources of Stonehenge‚Äôs bluestones in Mynydd Preseli, west Wales, have led to the discovery of stone tools associated with megalith quarrying in the final centuries of the fourth millennium BC, shortly before the suspected date of the bluestones‚Äô erection at Stonehenge, 240¬†km away. Among the most plentiful of these tools are stone wedges, three of which were found in situ at the rhyolite bluestone quarry of Craig Rhos-y-felin. Two of these were positioned in the joints of a rhyolite pillar adjacent to a recess left by a removed pillar. Geochemical analysis reveals that these and the third wedge are of compositions different to the rock on either side of the cracks into which they had been driven, confirming their identification as quarrying tools. This research sheds new light on the methods used to extract the stones for Stonehenge.

                  A Neolithic stone circle at Waun Mawn, in the Mynydd Preseli, west Wales, has been proposed as the original location of some dolerite megaliths at Stonehenge, including one known as Stone 62. To investigate this hypothesis, in-situ analyses, using a portable XRF, have been obtained for four extant non-spotted doleritic monoliths at Waun Mawn, along with two weathered doleritic fragments from a stonehole (number 91). The data obtained have been compared to data from spotted and non-spotted dolerite outcrops across the Mynydd Preseli, an area known to be the source of some Stonehenge doleritic bluestones, as well as data from in-situ analysis of Stone 62 (non-spotted dolerite) and ex-situ analysis of a core taken from Stone 62 in the late 1980‚Ä≤s.
                  Recently, Stone 62 has been identified as coming from Garn Ddu Fach, an outcrop some 6.79¬†km to the east-southeast of Waun Mawn. None of the four dolerite monoliths at Waun Mawn have compositions which match Stonehenge Stone 62, and neither do the weathered fragments from stonehole 91. Rather the data show that the Waun Mawn monoliths, and most probably the weathered stonehole fragments, can be sourced to Cerrig Lladron, 2.37¬†km southwest of Waun Mawn, suggesting that a very local stone source was used in construction of the Waun Mawn stone circle. It is noted that there is evidence that at least eight stones had been erected and subsequently removed from the Waun Mawn circle but probability analysis suggests strongly that the missing stones were also derived, at least largely, from Cerrig Lladron.

                    The Altar Stone at Stonehenge in Wiltshire, UK, is enigmatic in that it differs markedly from the other bluestones. It is a grey‚Äìgreen, micaceous sandstone and has been considered to be derived from the Old Red Sandstone sequences of South Wales. Previous studies, however, have been based on presumed derived fragments (debitage) that have been identified visually as coming from the Altar Stone. Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) analyses were conducted on these fragments (
                    ex situ
                    ) as well as on the Altar Stone (
                    in situ

                    Z
                    <37) in the Altar Stone analyses, performed after a night of heavy rain, were affected by surface and pore water that attenuate low energy X-rays, however the dry analyses of debitage fragments produced data for a full suite of elements. High
                    Z
                    elements, including Zr, Nb, Sr, Pb, Th and U, all occupy the same compositional space in the Altar Stone and debitage fragments, and are statistically indistinguishable, indicating the fragments are derived from the Altar Stone. Barium compares very closely between the debitage and Altar Stone, with differences being related to variable baryte distribution in the Altar Stone, limited accessibility of its surface for analysis, and probably to surface weathering.
                  A notable feature of the Altar Stone sandstone is the presence of baryte (up to 0.8 modal%), manifest as relatively high Ba in both the debitage and the Altar Stone. These high Ba contents are in marked contrast with those in a small set of Old Red Sandstone field samples, analysed alongside the Altar Stone and debitage fragments, raising the possibility that the Altar Stone may not have been sourced from the Old Red Sandstone sequences of Wales. This high Ba ‚Äòfingerprint‚Äô, related to the presence of baryte, may provide a rapid test using pXRF in the search for the source of the Stonehenge Altar Stone.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85127979995,crossref-doi

                  The doleritic bluestone monoliths at Stonehenge have long been known to have been sourced from the Mynydd Preseli area in west Wales, some 225¬†km away. On geochemical grounds, based on a range of major and trace elements determined by laboratory-based X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, they have been divided into three groups (Groups 1‚Äì3). Subsequently, rare earth element data obtained by solution nebulization ICP-MS showed Group 2 Stone 45 to have been sourced from Cerrigmarchogion with Group 2 Stone 62 showing similarities to the outcrops of Carn Ddafad-las and Garn Ddu Fach. In order to test this possible link, portable XRF (pXRF) analyses were obtained in situ from Stone 62 at Stonehenge and from key outcrops in the Preseli.
                  To obtain reliable results from heterogeneous coarse-grained igneous rocks using pXRF to enable comparisons between orthostats and possible sources, a robust analytical strategy was developed. For outcrops this involved a series of horizontal traverses through individual outcrops comprising 10 to 15 analyses a few centimetres apart, giving 60‚Äì175 independent analyses per outcrop. This gives a large, analysed surface area per outcrop providing representative data and also has potential to show any vertical variation in source outcrops. Analyses were taken from similarly weathered surfaces on orthostats and outcrops to minimise compositional changes from surface weathering, and a minimum of 20 analyses were taken from orthostats at various locations across the stone. This approach provides a set of well-determined elements which can reliably be used for provenance studies (including K, Fe, Mn, Zn, Rb, Sr, Zr, Nb, Ba). Nickel, Ti and V are affected slightly more by weathering but still prove useful in comparisons, but Cr, used in earlier studies as a compositional discriminant with Ni, here has poor accuracy by pXRF and is not used.
                  The pXRF analyses show that Stone 62 sits within the same ‚Äòcompositional space‚Äô (for multiple element concentrations and ranges) as analyses from Carn Ddafad-las and Garn Ddu Fach, two outcrops of the same intrusion which differ from all other analysed outcrops. More specifically, analyses from Stone 62 and Garn Ddu Fach overlap, these forming a subset of the analyses from Carn Ddafad-las, which shows a more extensive range of those same elements. On this basis it is suggested that Garn Ddu Fach is the likely source of Stonehenge non-spotted dolerite Stone 62, a suggestion supported by indistinguishable petrographic characteristics between Stone 62 and dolerite sample PGDF24 from Garn Ddu Fach.

                    Durrington Walls was a large Neolithic settlement in Britain dating around 2500 BCE, located very close to Stonehenge and likely to be the campsite where its builders lived during its main stage of construction. Nineteen coprolites recovered from a midden and associated pits at Durrington Walls were analysed for intestinal parasite eggs using digital light microscopy. Five (26%) contained helminth eggs, 1 with those of fish tapeworm (likely
                    Dibothriocephalus dendriticus
                    ) and 4 with those of capillariid nematodes. Analyses of bile acid and sterol from these 5 coprolites show 1 to be of likely human origin and the other 4 to likely derive from dogs. The presence of fish tapeworm reveals that the Neolithic people who gathered to feast at Durrington Walls were at risk of infection from eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish. When the eggs of capillariids are found in the feces of humans or dogs it normally indicates that the internal organs (liver, lung or intestines) of animals with capillariasis have been eaten, and eggs passed through the gut without causing disease. Their presence in multiple coprolites provides new evidence that internal organs of animals were consumed. These novel findings improve our understanding of both parasitic infection and dietary habits associated with this key Neolithic ceremonial site.

                  Geophysical survey methods have led to high-resolution mapping of subsurface remnants of ancient landscapes at continually expanding spatial scales. Yet, particularly when applied across entire archaeological landscapes, spanning hundreds of hectares, resultant datasets provide little direct information about inhabitation, environments or change over time.
                  Focusing on a 2.5¬†km2 area around Stonehenge, we show how geophysical soil survey, when combined with targeted sampling and excavation, can enable reliable empirically-grounded identification of complex activity traces. Particular focus lies on anthropogenic dug pits, identification and interpretation of which are vital in European earlier prehistoric archaeology due to their close connection with inhabitation and ceremonial practices. By integrating frequency domain electromagnetic and invasive datasets, and using a semi-automated interpretation scheme, we identified previously unknown concentrations of large pits (with diameters >2.4¬†m) among several thousand smaller pits and natural features across the Stonehenge landscape. Excavations of a subset of identified features demonstrate that, in this area, our investigative methodology is 66% accurate for identifying large anthropogenic pits. Our results have significant implications for understanding Stonehenge and its landscape setting, revealing elusive forms of Mesolithic to later Bronze Age land use that - even within the world's most intensively researched archaeological landscape - have gone unrecognized until now.
                  These findings underscore both the crucial role of archaeological excavation as an essential basis for reliable interpretation of geophysical data, as well as the perils of inductive visual interpretation of features‚Äô morphologies and their spatial configuration in non-invasive survey data.

However, little is known about the scale of pre-Neolithic activity and the extent to which the later monumental complex occupied an ‚Äòempty‚Äô landscape. There has been a long-running debate as to whether the monumental archaeology of Stonehenge was created in an uninhabited forested landscape or whether it was constructed in an already partly open area of pre-existing significance to late Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. This is of significance to a global discussion about the relationship between incoming farmers and indigenous hunter-gatherer societies that is highly relevant to both Old and New World archaeology. Here we present the results of plant sedaDNA, palynological and geoarchaeological analysis at the Late hunter-gatherer site complex of Blick Mead at the junction of the drylands of Salisbury Plain and the floodplain of the River Avon, on the edge of the Stonehenge World Heritage Site. The findings are placed within a chronological framework built on OSL, radiocarbon and relative archaeological dating. We show that Blick Mead existed in a clearing in deciduous woodland, exploited by aurochsen, deer and hunter-gatherers for approximately 4000 years. Given its rich archaeology and longevity this strongly supports the arguments of continuity between the Late Mesolithic hunter-gatherers activity and Neolithic monument builders, and more specifically that this was a partially open environment important to both groups. This study also demonstrates that sediments from low-energy floodplains can provide suitable samples for successful environmental assaying using sedaDNA, provided they are supported by secure dating and complementary environmental proxies.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128940603,crossref-doi

We propose an algorithm for navigating a robot through a 3D environment represented as a NeRF using only an onboard RGB camera for localization. We assume the NeRF for the scene has been pre-trained offline, and the robotís objective is to navigate through unoccupied space in the NeRF to reach a goal pose. We introduce a trajectory optimization algorithm that avoids collisions with high-density regions in the NeRF based on a discrete time version of differential flatness that is amenable to constraining the robotís full pose and control inputs. We also introduce an optimization based filtering method to estimate 6DoF pose and velocities for the robot in the NeRF given only an onboard RGB camera.

However, a prevalence of brain-imaging evidence now shows that the cerebral cortex, while the seat of our everyday experience (notably in working memory), is not predominant in actually formulating our amazing capabilities. Rather, the achievements that mark humans as ìHomo sapiensî originate in the cerebellum which increased three- to fourfold in size and acquired massive cognitive and social optimization capabilities over the last million years. Thus, through its optimization of experience and skill of the cerebral cortex, it was the cerebellum that was and is predominant in producing culture, language, mathematics, creativity, and extreme levels of skill in all areas from sports to computer science and art. These optimizing functions of the cerebellum are shown in the cases of Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Maryam Mirzakhani, and the predictive powers of Stonehenge.

Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of sarsen samples taken directly from a Stonehenge megalith (Stone 58, in the centrally placed trilithon horseshoe). We apply state-of-the-art petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical techniques to two cores drilled from the stone during conservation work in 1958. Petrographic analyses demonstrate that Stone 58 is a highly indurated, grain-supported, structureless and texturally mature groundwater silcrete, comprising fine-to-medium grained quartz sand cemented by optically-continuous syntaxial quartz overgrowths. In addition to detrital quartz, trace quantities of silica-rich rock fragments, Fe-oxides/hydroxides and other minerals are present. Cathodoluminescence analyses show that the quartz cement developed as an initial <10 Œºm thick zone of non-luminescing quartz followed by ~16 separate quartz cement growth zones. Late-stage Fe-oxides/hydroxides and Ti-oxides line and/or infill some pores. Automated mineralogical analyses indicate that the sarsen preserves 7.2 to 9.2 area % porosity as a moderately-connected intergranular network.

These results are therefore representative of the main stone type used to build what is arguably the most important Late Neolithic monument in Europe.

                  The doleritic bluestones of Stonehenge, sourced from the Mynydd Preseli in west Wales, have been previously classified into three geochemical groups on the basis of compatible element geochemistry (Bevins et al., 2014). The majority of Group 1 (spotted) dolerites were identified as coming from the outcrop of Carn Goedog, Group 3 (spotted) dolerites were linked to the outcrops Carn Breseb, Carn Gyfrwy, outcrops in the vicinity of Carn Alw and an un-named outcrop west of Carn Ddafad-las and Group 2 (non-spotted) dolerites were identified as coming from either Cerrigmarchogion or Craig Talfynydd. A sub-set of the samples used by Bevins et al. (2014) have been re-analysed by solution nebulisation ICP-MS, including analyses of the rare earth elements (REE).
                  Analysis of the REE data reveals that Groups 1 and 3 dolerites from both Stonehenge and the Preseli have very similar REE patterns which strongly suggests that they are derived from a single intrusive body. Group 2 non-spotted dolerites are now divided, on the basis of their REE contents, into four Preseli and two Stonehenge sub-groups, (Groups 2i-2iv and Groups 2v-2vi, respectively) while Stonehenge orthostat sample SH44 plots apart from all other Stonehenge and Preseli samples in all discriminant diagrams used. The new data show that Preseli Group 2i dolerites have very distinct concave down ‚Äúhumped‚Äù patterns and bear no resemblance to any analysed Stonehenge dolerites. The source of Stonehenge Group 2v dolerites remains equivocal; they plot close to Preseli Group 2ii dolerites from Carn Ddafad-las and Garn Ddu Fach and have in common the presence of notable positive Eu anomalies, but they show minor differences, especially in relation to their Gdn/Ybn ratios. However, Stonehenge orthostat sample SH45 shows a near identical REE composition to Preseli Group 2iii dolerites from Cerrigmarchogion.

                  Stonehenge is dominated by the large, locally derived sarsen stones which comprise the Outer Sarsen Circle and the Inner Sarsen Trilithon Circle. Lithologically they are a hard form of sandstone called silcrete. Less obvious are the smaller ‚Äòbluestones‚Äô which form the Outer Bluestone Circle and Inner Bluestone Horseshoe. The bluestone assemblage is composed of a variety of lithologies, including dolerite (almost all carrying small, cm scale, white to pink ‚Äòspots‚Äô), rhyolites, volcanic tuffs and two different types of sandstone. The majority of the bluestones have been provenanced to the Mynydd Preseli area in west Wales some 200¬†km west of Stonehenge, and the distinctive spots in the dolerites were crucial evidence in making that link. However, despite the importance of the spots in that provenancing model, which provides evidence for one of the most remarkable feats of Neolithic time in north-west Europe, they have been little studied and are not fully characterized. One reason for this is the fact that they are difficult to study using standard optical microscopy because of the fine grain size of the component minerals. In order to gain a greater understanding of the mineralogy and origin of the spots we have used a range of alternative optical and analytical techniques, including high resolution photomicrography, ‚Äòstandard‚Äô electron microscopy (SEM-EDS), automated scanning electron microscopy with linked energy dispersive analysis (automated SEM-EDS) and X-ray diffraction. These investigations, based primarily on samples from Carn Goedog and Carn Meini in the Mynydd Preseli, lead us to conclude that the spots result from a two-stage alteration history involving firstly saussuritization of primary igneous calcium-rich plagioclase phenocrysts/glomerocrysts. The saussuritization was probably a late-stage magmatic event, possibly occurring at ca. 400¬†¬∞C, and led to the development of the secondary minerals clinozoisite, zoisite, albite and muscovite. Subsequently, the dolerites were affected by regional low-grade metamorphism at ca. 250‚Äì300¬†¬∞C, at the transition from the prehnite-pumpellyite to the greenschist facies. During this metamorphism the background (non-spot) areas of the samples were altered with the development of the secondary minerals chlorite, actinolite, epidote, quartz, titanite and further albite. Interpretation of these data shows that the Carn Goedog sample has a higher percentage of secondary minerals compared to the Carn Meini sample, suggesting that the former shows a higher degree of alteration. Further analyses of dolerite samples from the Mynydd Preseli should provide insight into the potential of the extent of rock alteration in the further refinement of understanding the source or sources of the Stonehenge bluestone dolerites.

Initially interpreted as dewponds, these data have been re-evaluated, along with information on similar features revealed by archaeological contractors undertaking survey and excavation to the north of the Durrington Walls henge. Analysis of the available data identified a total of 20 comparable features, which align within a series of arcs adjacent to Durrington Walls. Further geophysical survey, supported by mechanical coring, was undertaken on several geophysical anomalies to assess their nature, and to provide dating and environmental evidence. The results of fieldwork demonstrate that some of these features, at least, were massive, circular pits with a surface diameter of 20m or more and a depth of at least 5m. Struck flint and bone were recovered from primary silts and radiocarbon dating indicates a Late Neolithic date for the lower silts of one pit. The degree of similarity across the 20 features identified suggests that they could have formed part of a circuit of large pits around Durrington Walls, and this may also have incorporated the recently discovered Larkhill causewayed enclosure. The diameter of the circuit of pits exceeds 2km and there is some evidence that an intermittent, inner post alignment may have existed within the circuit of pits.

                  With social rituals usually involving sound, an archaeological understanding of a site requires the acoustics to be assessed. This paper demonstrates how this can be done with acoustic scale models. Scale modelling is an established method in architectural acoustics, but it has not previously been applied to prehistoric monuments. The Stonehenge model described here allows the acoustics in the Late Neolithic and early Bronze Age to be quantified and the effects on musical sounds and speech to be inferred. It was found that the stone reflections create an average mid-frequency reverberation time of (0.64¬†¬±¬†0.03) seconds and an amplification of (4.3¬†¬±¬†0.9) dB for speech. The model has a more accurate representation of the prehistoric geometry, giving a reverberation time that is significantly greater than that measured in the current ruin and a full-size concrete replica at Maryhill, USA. The amplification could have aided speech communication and the reverberation improved musical sounds. How Stonehenge was used is much debated, but these results show that sounds were improved within the circle compared to outside. Stonehenge had different configurations, especially in terms of the positions of the bluestones. However, this made inaudible changes to the acoustics, suggesting sound is unlikely to be the underlying motivation for the various arrangements.

                  The Altar Stone at Stonehenge is a greenish sandstone thought to be of Late Silurian-Devonian (‚ÄòOld Red Sandstone‚Äô) age. It is classed as one of the bluestone lithologies which are considered to be exotic to the Salisbury Plain environ, most of which are derived from the Mynydd Preseli, in west Wales. However, no Old Red Sandstone rocks crop out in the Preseli; instead a source in the Lower Old Red Sandstone Cosheston Subgroup at Mill Bay to the south of the Preseli, has been proposed. More recently, on the basis of detailed petrography, a source for the Altar Stone much further to the east, towards the Wales-England border, has been suggested. Quantitative analyses presented here compare mineralogical data from proposed Stonehenge Altar Stone debris with samples from Milford Haven at Mill Bay, as well as with a second sandstone type found at Stonehenge which is Lower Palaeozoic in age. The Altar Stone samples have contrasting modal mineralogies to the other two sandstone types, especially in relation to the percentages of its calcite, kaolinite and barite cements. Further differences between the Altar Stone sandstone and the Cosheston Subgroup sandstone are seen when their contained zircons are compared, showing differing morphologies and U-Pb age dates having contrasting populations. These data confirm that Mill Bay is not the source of the Altar Stone with the abundance of kaolinite in the Altar Stone sample suggesting a source further east, towards the Wales-England border. The disassociation of the Altar Stone and Milford Haven undermines the hypothesis that the bluestones, including the Altar Stone, were transported from west Wales by sea up the Bristol Channel and adds further credence to a totally land-based route, possibly along a natural routeway leading from west Wales to the Severn estuary and beyond. This route may well have been significant in prehistory, raising the possibility that the Altar Stone was added en route to the assemblage of Preseli bluestones taken to Stonehenge around or shortly before 3000 BC. Recent strontium isotope analysis of human and animal bones from Stonehenge, dating to the beginning of its first construction stage around 3000 BC, are consistent with the suggestion of connectivity between this western region of Britain and Salisbury Plain.This study appears to be the first application of quantitative automated mineralogy in the provenancing of archaeological lithic material and highlights the potential value of automated mineralogy in archaeological provenancing investigations, especially when combined with complementary techniques, in the present case zircon age dating.

Middle Neolithic pits are present in significant numbers across King Barrow Ridge, and alongside pits in the Durrington area, form one of the densest concentrations of such activity in the region.

Vibration mitigation near the source can reduce the problem. The paper investigates the effect of circular arrays of blocks, placed on the ground surface around the position at which the pile is driven. A semi-analytical model of a layered soil has been used for the analysis, and the blocks have been modelled as monolithic structures, ac-counting for the full structureñsoilñstructure interaction. Two different sites have been studied: a layered soil with three metres of soft sand over a half-space of till, and a five metres deep layer of soft clay overlying a half-space of lime. The block arrays consist of one to three con-centric rings with radii 4, 8, and 12 m, respectively. The rings contain 6, 12, and 24 blocks, respectively, and the size of the blocks have been scaled such that each ring has the same total mass. The pile has not been modelled explicitly; instead vertical excitation has been applied in different depts over a circular area corresponding to the cross section of a pile. For the con-sidered cases it has been found that an array of blocks, shaped as a ìStonehengeî, may provide significant mitigation of the ground vibration level in a receiver zone placed 20ñ40 m from the pile. When a load is applied within the soft topsoil layer, the array provides an insertion loss in the order of 5ñ20 dB, depending on the size of the blocks and the configuration of the arrays. For loads applied deeper in the soil, within the stiffer half-space, the insertion loss is small and may in some situations be negative. However, this must be seen in the context that the transfer mobility in the reference state without the blocks, i.e. the greenfield, is low when the load is applied within the stiff half-space.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85098699151,NOT FOUND

Or at least, this was how the research was presented in the media, e.g., ‚ÄòAncient-genome study finds Bronze Age ‚ÄòBeaker culture‚Äô invaded Britain‚Äô or ‚ÄòDid Dutch hordes kill off the early Britons who started Stonehenge?‚Äô.

Issues with standard acoustic methods are discussed, and a range of different possible approaches are explored for sound archaeology studies, also known as archaeoacoustics. The context of the three sites are examined followed by an analysis of their acoustic properties. Firstly, early decay time is explored, including a comparison of these sites to contemporary concert halls. Subsequently, reverberation, clarity of speech, and bass response are examined. Results show that the caves have a wide range of different naturally occurring acoustics, including reverberation, and strong bass effects. Stonehenge has acoustics that change as the design of the site develops, with some similarities to the effects in the caves. Acoustic effects vary considerably as you move further into the centre of the stone circle, and as the stone circle develops through time; these effects would be noticeable, and are a by-product of the human building of ritual sites. At Paphos Theatre, acoustics vary from the best seats on the front rows, backwards; here, the architects have considered acoustics in the design of the building.

                  Little synthesis of evidence for Middle Neolithic food and farming in Wiltshire, particularly in and around the Stonehenge World Heritage Site (WHS) has been possible, until now, due to a paucity of assemblages. The excavation of a cluster of five Middle Neolithic pits and an inhumation burial at West Amesbury Farm (WAF) has prompted a review of our understanding of pit sites of this period from the county. Bioarchaeological assemblages are used to investigate evidence for the consumption of animal and plant-based foods, and for agricultural and pastoral farming. For the first time Middle Neolithic zooarchaeological evidence, including strontium isotope data, is considered alongside archaeobotanical data, and radiocarbon dating.
                  The absence of cultivated plants from WAF and contemporary sites in the county is consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction in cereal cultivation and greater reliance of wild plants witnessed in the later part of the Neolithic in southern England began in the Middle Neolithic. The zooarchaeological evidence from the same sites demonstrates that the shift away from cereal cultivation may be concurrent with, rather than earlier than, an increase in the relative proportion of deposited pig bones relative to cattle.
                  Both cattle and pigs deposited in pits at WAF have strontium and sulphur isotope values consistent with the local biosphere, and therefore were potentially raised in the area. Zooarchaeological data from WAF compliments that from human dental calculus and lipid residues in associated Peterborough Ware pottery that local cattle husbandry included exploitation of dairy. It also highlights the presence of consistent food preparation methods between pits as seen through butchery practice.
                  The faunal and archaeobotanical remains from contemporary pit deposits suggest that similar farming and subsistence strategies can be proposed across the county, though with some inter-site variation in deposition. Together these excavated pit sites are likely to represent only a sample of those present in the area. Application of a similar integrated approach to material from other Middle Neolithic pits holds potential for better understanding of food and farming in this previously neglected period.

                    Methiozolin is a new herbicide that controls annual bluegrass (
                    Poa annua

                    Festuca brevipila
                    ). Nine different fine fescue populations (14W2 Comp, Fairmont, and Survivor chewings fescue; FT345, Miser, and Fenway strong creeping red fescue; and 14H4 Comp, Stonehenge, and Oxford hard fescue) were sprayed with methiozolin at five different rates (0.42, 0.83, 1.25, 1.67, and 2.09 lb/acre) at four different application timings [4 weeks before seeding (WBS), 2 WBS, at seeding (AS), and 2 weeks after germination (WAG)]. Untreated controls were also included for each combination. Significant reduction in germination of fine fescue was observed when methiozolin was applied before emergence for all tested application rates. Methiozolin at 1.25, 1.67, and 2.09 lb/acre applied before or at the day of seeding led to complete inhibition of germination in all fine fescue species tested. It was less injurious compared with methiozolin applied at 2 WAG, although a reduction in the percentage of green cover and biomass was observed for application rates greater or equal to 0.83 lb/acre. The hierarchical ranking of species injury from high to low is as follows: hard fescue, chewings fescue, and strong creeping red fescue. A possible solution for annual bluegrass control in fine fescue species with methiozolin is multiple postemergence applications up to a maximum rate of 0.83 lb/acre. Turf managers need to make adjustments in methiozolin application rates and timings based on fine fescue species to maximize selectivity for annual bluegrass control.

                  A single domestic dog (Canis familiaris) tooth was recovered from the Mesolithic site of Blick Mead in the Stonehenge landscape. As no human remains were recovered from the site, the dog tooth provides a potential proxy for reconstructing human diet. Previous studies have shown that domestic dogs often have similar Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N values to their human companions. Incremental dentine carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis and bulk enamel carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope analysis were obtained from the tooth to produce a life-history profile of the dog's diet and mobility. The Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N values indicate that there was little variation in the dog's diet between c.2 and 6‚ÄØmonths of age. Œ¥15N values range between +7.9 to +8.7‚Ä∞, (mean +8.5‚Ä∞), whereas Œ¥13C values range between ‚àí21.3 and ‚àí20.5‚Ä∞, (mean ‚àí20.9‚Ä∞). These data suggest that the dog was consuming predominantly terrestrial herbivorous protein, with the possible inclusion of freshwater fish. The enamel 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.70796 can only be obtained from a chalk landscape, such as is found at Blick Mead and elsewhere in southern and southeastern Britain, or basalt terrains which are rare in southern Britain. The enamel Œ¥18O(SMOW) value of 25.7‚Ä∞ is not consistent with the dog residing at Blick Mead but appropriate contemporaneous data from dogs is currently lacking. The results are thus consistent with the dog originating in a chalk or possibly basaltic terrain elsewhere in Britain and Ireland or that the dog resided locally at a time when the climate was colder than present.

Trans-right axillary aortic valve replacement (TAX-AVR) remains uncommon. We developed a special method to pull the heart closer to the right chest wall to make the surgery as easy and safe as aortic valve replacement via median sternotomy. Because the retraction sutures lifting the ascending aorta and aortic root are arranged circularly around the wound, we named this technique ìStonehenge techniqueî.

Methods
We examined 47 patients who underwent aortic valve replacement through a small right infra-axillary thoracotomy as the initial surgical therapy. These patients were divided into two groups: the conventional TAX-AVR group that underwent AVR via the conventional small right axillary incision approach (n?=?20) and the TAX-AVR with SH group that underwent AVR with the Stonehenge technique (n?=?27).

Results
The aortic cross-clamp and the extracorporeal circulation time were significantly shorter in the TAX-AVR with SH group than in the conventional TAX-AVR group (conventional TAX-AVR group: 125.5?±?47.9; TAX-AVR with SH group: 96.0?±?14.0, p?=?0.004, and conventional TAX-AVR group: 163.8?±?55.9; TAX-AVR with SH group: 140.0?±?16.8, p?=?0.04).

Conclusion
The outcomes of this technique depend on the site of the retraction sutures in the opened pericardium, direction of pull, amount of force applied, and precautions taken. If performed correctly, the ascending aorta and the root can be pulled from the wound to within the surgeonís fingersí reach, thereby reducing aortic cross-clamp and extracorporeal circulation times in group of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via right infra-axillary thoracotomy.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051806452,NOT FOUND

The practice of cremation has, however, precluded the application of strontium isotope analysis of tooth enamel as the standard chemical approach to study their origin. New developments in strontium isotopic analysis of cremated bone reveal that at least 10 of the 25 cremated individuals analysed did not spend their lives on the Wessex chalk on which the monument is found. Combined with the archaeological evidence, we suggest that their most plausible origin lies in west Wales, the source of the bluestones erected in the early stage of the monument‚Äôs construction.

The popular tourist destination with rapid economic development and agricultural expansion contrasts sharply with an environment of limited water resources and landscape erosion. The recent discovery of Prehispanic hydraulic systems underscore ancient responses to water shortages conditioned by climate change. In an environment where effective rainfall and erosion are problematic, irrigation was vital to human settlement in this semi-arid highland valley. A chiefly elite responded to unpredictable precipitation by engineering a hydraulic landscape sanctioned by religious cosmology and the monolithic observatory at El Infiernito, the Stonehenge of Colombia. Early Colonial water works, however, transformed Villa de Leyva into a wheat breadbasket, though climatic downturns and poor management strategies contributed to an early 17th century crash in wheat production. Today, housing construction, intensive agriculture, and environmental instability combine to recreate conditions for acute water shortages. The heritage of a relatively dry valley with a long history of hydraulic chiefdoms, of which modern planners seem unaware, raises concerns for conservation and vulnerability to climate extremes and the need for understanding the prehistoric context and the magnitude of water availability today. This paper examines human ecodynamic factors related to the legacy of Muisca chiefdoms in the Leiva Valley and relevant issues of heritage in an Andean region undergoing rapid socio-economic change.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118767076,crossref-doi

                  Osteobiographies of four individuals whose skeletal remains were recovered in 2015‚Äì16 from the Stonehenge World Heritage Site are constructed, drawing upon evidence from funerary taphonomy, radiocarbon dating, osteological study, stable isotope analyses, and microscopic and biomolecular analyses of dental calculus. The burials comprise an adult from the Middle Neolithic period, immediately prior to the building of Stonehenge, and two adults and a perinatal infant dating from the Middle Bronze Age, shortly after the monument ceased to be structurally modified. The two Middle Bronze Age adults were closely contemporary, but differed from one another in ancestry, appearance and geographic origin (key components of ethnicity). They were nevertheless buried in very similar ways. This suggests that aspects they held in common (osteological analysis suggests perhaps a highly mobile lifestyle) were more important in determining the manner of deposition of their bodies than any differences between them in ethnicity. One of these individuals probably came from outside Britain, as perhaps did the Middle Neolithic adult. This would be consistent with the idea that the Stonehenge landscape had begun to draw people to it from beyond Britain before Stonehenge was constructed and that it continued to do so after structural modification to the monument had ceased.

core of liberal learning. Further, the proposed ABET student outcome five requires
students to have: An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in
engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of
engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.
A new course has been developed (and is a work in progress at the time of this paper) for
both engineering and non-engineering students studying abroad entitled ìLondonís Built
Environment.î The course was designed primarily to foster studentsí understanding of
the relationship between the built environment that surrounds them, the natural
environment in which it is built and the human and social environment for which it was
designed and built. Since the first offering of the course is in London, the course is
entitled ìLondonís Built Environment.î This course explores the relationships between
Londoners, and more broadly Britons, and their built environment. The course included
classroom lectures, guest lecturers and, most importantly, field trips. Lecture topics
included a history of the development of the British Isles (e.g. Stone age through the
present), London geology and natural subsurface environment and their role in shaping
the historic and modern city; the role of clean water and waste management from ancient
through modern times including the historic development of modern indoor plumbing
and the unintended consequences thereof; the role of transportation infrastructure in
urban development; and sustainable urban development. Lectures were also delivered in
the field during walking tours led either by the course instructor or by those with local
expertise. Site visits included walking tours with specific themes, thematic museums
such as the Museum of London and the London Mithrium, and site visits to Greenwich
and the Tower of London. Also included were trips outside of London to the UKís best
examples of the built environment including Stonehenge, Salisbury, York, Bath and
Cambridge. The built environment was explored generally in a chronological manner
beginning with Neolithic settlements capitalizing on the natural environment and
progressing through various ages with particular emphasis on Roman, Medieval,
Elizabethan, Georgian, Victorian, and modern time periods.
Throughout the course, a recurring theme was for the students to consider how and why
the built environment is as it is and to compare and contrast that with their own
experiences in the US and elsewhere. The course was designed as an active learning
course with discussion, field trips and student presentations. In addition to ABET student
outcome five above, two other goals of the course were:
ï prepare students for meaningful involvement with a rapidly changing world
characterized by diverse individual perspectives, globalization and multi-cultural
interactions, and scientific/technological innovation; and
ï provide students with opportunities to build and enhance their abilities to
understand the social and natural worlds around them; to analyze, evaluate, and
integrate the information available to them; and to synthesize and communicate
thought effectively.
While the paper describes the course as it is being delivered in London and more broadly
the United Kingdom, it is believed that this course can be adapted to any environment in
which the course is delivered, whether that be in the US or abroad. Note that as this final
paper is submitted, it is at the end of the first half of the course so this is a work in

                  Carbon isotope measurements of individual fatty acids (C16:0 and C18:0) recovered from archaeological pottery vessels are widely used in archaeology to investigate past culinary and economic practices. Typically, such isotope measurements are matched with reference to food sources for straightforward source identification, or simple linear models are used to investigate mixing of contents. However, in cases where multiple food sources were processed in the same vessel, these approaches result in equivocal solutions. To address this issue, we tested the use of a Bayesian mixing model to determine the proportional contribution of different food sources to a series of different mixed food compositions, using data generated both by simulation and by experiment. The model was then applied to previously published fatty acid isotope datasets from pottery from two prehistoric sites: Durrington Walls, near Stonehenge in southern Britain and Neustadt in northern Germany. We show that the Bayesian approach to the reconstruction of pottery use offers a reliable probabilistic interpretation of source contributions although the analysis also highlights the relatively low precision achievable in quantifying pottery contents from datasets of this nature. We suggest that, with some refinement, the approach outlined should become standard practice in organic residue analysis, and also has potential application to a wide range of geological and geochemical investigations.

In most instances they were placed within cut features and, in one case, a series of cremation deposits was associated with a broken standing stone. This paper includes the first detailed assessment of the cremated remains at Forteviot and the features associated with the cemetery, and explores how the establishment of this cemetery may have been both a catalyst and inspiration for the elaborate monument building and prolonged acts of remembrance that occurred at this location over a period of almost 1000 years. The paper also outlines the parallels for Forteviot across Britain and, for the first time, draws together the dating evidence (including Bayesian modelling) for this major category of evidence for considering the nature of late 4th/early 3rd millennium cal

108,Light in Architecture as an Inspired Theme,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,Conference Paper,04-11-17,10.1088/1757-899X/245/4/042038,SCOPUS_ID:85033729782,2-s2.0-85033729782,"The theme of the article is to highlight the important role of natural light in architecture. Natural light, or solar radiation absorbed by our sense of sight was a strong inspiration from ancient times. Originally constituted as a link between heaven and earth. It played a major role in shaping the places of worship, such as even Stonehenge. In the church architecture it was and still is the guiding element, the main matrix around builds an architecture narrative. Over the centuries, the study of the role of light in architecture, and in fact chiaroscuro, led to the culmination of solutions full of fantasy and ""quirks"" in the Baroque era (Baroque with Italian barocco: strange, exaggerated). Enamored of carved body and the use of multipurpose ornament topped was the discovery of a concave-convex faÁade parete ondulata created by Francesca Borrromini. Conscious manipulation of light developed, at the time, to a maximum of the art illusion and optical illusions in architectural buildings. Changing the perception of privilege in detail and introduce the principle of ""beauty comes from functionality"" in times of modernism meant that architects started to look for the most extreme simplicity. Sincerity of forms, and thus the lack of ornamentation, however, did not result in a lack of interest in light. On the contrary, the light became detail, eye-catching element against a smooth surface of the wall. The continuation of this concept of creating a strong password exposing Mies van der Rohe's ""less is more"" took over the architecture created in the current minimalism. To minimize the detail with the introduction of large glazing resulted in strengthening the effect of opening the flow of light and penetrating the interior to the exterior. The principle of deep reflection on the light is certainly used in the design of monumental buildings, such as galleries, museums. It could be used more widely in the common architecture, noting the heritage and experience gained in the different architecture styles in working with natural light.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85033729782,NOT FOUND

The key to understanding these questions relies heavily on the location of their sources. Following early studies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, which proposed various places but in particular south-west England, H.H. Thomas, in 1923, suggested that they came from the Mynydd Preseli, in north Pembrokeshire, Wales. Thomas proposed a number of key locations for the geographical origin of the stones. However, recent investigations have called those locations into question, identifying different sources albeit from the same broad area in north Pembrokeshire. Identification of these proposed new sites has led to archaeological excavations and important new discoveries including new suggested routes for the transport of the bluestones from the Preseli Hills to Stonehenge some 230 km away.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029722778,NOT FOUND

                  Ground investigations for the A303 Stonehenge Tunnels revealed a unique and complex Chalk geology including the presence of the thickest (>20m thick), and previously unknown phosphatic chalks in England, partly filling fault controlled erosional channels. The use of natural gamma-ray borehole logs to determine the presence and thickness of the phosphatic deposits is of particular value and combined with the lithostratigraphy, macrofossil and nannofossil biostratigraphy from cores has, for the first time, accurately constrained the Coniacian to Santonian age and the lenticular geometry of such deposits. Four phosphatic chalk events between 88.5‚Äì86.5Ma are recognised associated with synsedimentary faulting. We suggest a causal link between tectonics, subsidence and channel-formation, phosphatisation events, pulses of oceanic upwelling on a frequency of about 0.5 million years to mantle-controlled plate tectonic episodes. The implications of this geology for construction of the A303 and the archaeology of the area are discussed.

                  Spectral variations of vegetation, known as crop marks, have been widely used for archaeological research as a proxy to detect buried archaeological remains. Such marks can be recognized using space-borne data and image analysis techniques supported by the existing archaeological knowledge of the area under study. Orthogonal equations for the enhancement and detection of crop marks using multispectral satellite images have been recently proposed in the literature. The proposed equations are linear transformations of the initial spectral bands of multispectral datasets aiming to the improvement of the satellite images. For the calculation of the n-space coefficients of this linear transformation a four-step methodology was followed, separately for each sensor. This paper aims to provide the fundamental concept of the development of these equations as well as some aspects related with the application and accuracy assessment. Spectral characteristics of the sensor, atmospheric effects, and spectral calibration of the datasets as well as the selection of the appropriate period for applying these equations for the enhancements of crop marks are also discussed. Such orthogonal equations may be further developed and applied for any kind of sensor either hyperspectral or multispectral for the detection of buried archaeological remains. An example of the applicability of the orthogonal equations at Stonehenge archaeological site is also demonstrated.

These features were succeeded by a major ditch system in which two individuals were buried, an unusual way of dealing with the dead in the Middle Bronze Age. At the same time, the body of a perinatal infant was deposited in a palisade ditch in the western part of the WHS.

The findings from these investigations are beginning to shed more light on the possible origins and development of these important but weakly understood landscapes.

Locally sourced, little consideration has been given to the process of acquisition and movement of sarsen stones that make up key monuments such as the Avebury henge and its avenues, attention instead focusing on the middle-distance transportation of sarsen out of this region to Stonehenge. Though stone movements were local, we argue they were far from lacking in significance, as indicated by the subsequent monumentalization of at least two locations from which they were likely acquired. We argue that since such stones embodied place(s), their removal, movement and resetting represented a remarkably dynamic and potentially disruptive reconfiguration of the world as it was known.

New stratigraphic interpretations, and isotopic data presented here, are consistent with the HPS having formed at the Palaeocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum.

The current distribution of Hertfordshire Puddingstone is shown, reflecting periglacial movement and human clearance. The production process is outlined for the main agency involved, the Romano-British puddingstone quern industry (AD 50‚Äì150). Sarsen-cutting, particularly in Wiltshire and Buckinghamshire between 1850 and 1939, provides a parallel case of clearance of boulders from the landscape.

                  Around 4500 years ago, some 80 large blocks of silcrete or ‚Äòsarsen‚Äô were erected at Stonehenge during its second stage of construction. Stonehenge is the only prehistoric stone circle to have its stones dressed, and debris from this stone-dressing has been found on the north side of the monument. Numerous locations have been proposed for the origin of these sarsens, from the immediate locality to more distant areas of east Somerset and north Wiltshire about 30km (18 miles) away, but geological provenancing of Stonehenge's silcrete monoliths has so far been largely unsuccessful. The suspected sources are, however, much closer than those of Stonehenge's ‚Äòbluestones‚Äô, over 200km (125 miles) away in west Wales. That said, the sarsens are much heavier than the 1‚Äì2tonne bluestones. For more than 300 years, researchers have suspected that the main sources of Stonehenge's sarsens were deposits of silcrete on the highest points of the Marlborough Downs, 30km (18 miles) north of Stonehenge. Antiquarian records of a group of sarsens at Clatford Bottom, at the foot of the Downs, suggest that these may have been abandoned in transit to Stonehenge.

To counter such limiting and one-dimensional assessments of the discipline, this research highlights how archaeology as a study concerned with space, place and materiality can be mobilised to investigate the digital realm.

We explore how concreting changed between 1901 and the Second World War, and the implications of this for constructions of prehistory. We discuss the role of concrete in debates surrounding restoration, analyze the semiotics of concrete equivalents for the megaliths, and investigate how concreting became meaningful in interpretations of prehistoric building activities.

This volume explores this critical transformation, from the appearance of the earliest cities in Mesopotamia and Egypt to the rise of cities in Asia and the Mediterranean world, Africa, and the Americas. Through case studies and comparative accounts of key cities across the world, leading scholars chart the ways in which these cities grew as nodal points of pilgrimages and ceremonies, exchange, storage and redistribution, and centres for defence and warfare. They show how in these cities, along with their associated and restructured countrysides, new rituals and ceremonies connected leaders with citizens and the gods, new identities as citizens were created, and new forms of power and sovereignty emerged. They also examine how this unprecedented concentration of people led to disease, violence, slavery and subjugations of unprecedented kinds and scales.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84953432694,crossref-doi

In the first part, she examines knowledge systems within historically recorded oral cultures, showing how the link between power and the control of knowledge is established. Analyzing the material mnemonic devices used by documented oral cultures, she demonstrates how early societies maintained a vast corpus of pragmatic information concerning animal behavior, plant properties, navigation, astronomy, genealogies, laws and trade agreements, among other matters. In the second part Kelly turns to the archaeological record of three sites, Chaco Canyon, Poverty Point and Stonehenge, offering new insights into the purpose of the monuments and associated decorated objects. This book demonstrates how an understanding of rational intellect, pragmatic knowledge and mnemonic technologies in prehistoric societies offers a new tool for analysis of monumental structures built by non-literate cultures.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84953280322,crossref-doi

                    Despite being one of the most intensively explored prehistoric monuments in western Europe, Stonehenge continues to hold surprises. The principal elements of the complex are well known: the outer bank and ditch, the sarsen circle capped by lintels, the smaller bluestone settings and the massive central trilithons. They represent the final phase of Stonehenge, the end product of a complicated sequence that is steadily being refined (most recently in Darvill

                  Archaeological research at Stonehenge (UK) is increasingly aimed at understanding the dynamic of the wider archaeological landscape. Through the application of state-of-the-art geophysical techniques, unprecedented insight is being gathered into the buried archaeological features of the area. However, applied survey techniques have rarely targeted natural soil variation, and the detailed knowledge of the palaeotopography is consequently less complete. In addition, metallic topsoil debris, scattered over different parts of the Stonehenge landscape, often impacts the interpretation of geophysical datasets. The research presented here demonstrates how a single multi-receiver electromagnetic induction (EMI) survey, conducted over a 22¬†ha area within the Stonehenge landscape, offers detailed insight into natural and anthropogenic soil variation at Stonehenge. The soil variations that were detected through recording the electrical and magnetic soil variability, shed light on the genesis of the landscape, and allow for a better definition of potential palaeoenvironmental and archaeological sampling locations. Based on the multi-layered dataset, a procedure was developed to remove the influence of topsoil metal from the survey data, which enabled a more straightforward identification of the detected archaeology. The results provide a robust basis for further geoarchaeological research, while potential to differentiate between modern soil disturbances and the underlying sub-surface variations can help in solving conservation and management issues. Through expanding this approach over the wider area, we aim at a fuller understanding of the human‚Äìlandscape interactions that have shaped the Stonehenge landscape.

                  The Stonehenge bluestones were first sourced to outcrops in the high parts of the eastern Mynydd Preseli in SW Wales by H.H. Thomas in the early 1920s. He recognised the distinctive ‚Äòspotted dolerite‚Äô from his fieldwork in that area and suggested that the tors of Carn Meini (also known as Carn Menyn) and Cerrigmarchogion were the most likely sources. In the early 1990s, in a major contribution to our understanding of the Stonehenge bluestones, the geochemistry of a set of samples from Stonehenge monoliths and debitage was determined and compared against the geochemistry of dolerites from the eastern Mynydd Preseli by a team from the Open University led by R.S. Thorpe. They argued that the majority of the Stonehenge dolerites could be sourced from outcrops in the Carn Meini-Carn Gyfrwy area, based on the concentrations of the so-called ‚Äòimmobile‚Äô elements (elements which are not affected by rock alteration processes), in particular TiO2, Y, and Zr. However, these elements are incompatible during crystallization of mineral phases in basaltic systems (that is they do not enter into the mineral phases which are crystallizing but are concentrated in the residual liquid) which severely hampers their use in discriminating between different pulses of an evolving magma (as is the case of the doleritic sills emplaced high in the crust and now exposed in the Mynydd Preseli). An alternative strategy in this study re-examines the data set of Thorpe's team but investigates the concentration of elements which are compatible in such basaltic systems (that is elements which do enter into the crystallizing mineral phases), namely MgO, Ni, Cr and Fe2O3. On the basis of the abundances of these elements on bivariate plots and also by using Principal Component Analysis on the dataset available and various sub-sets we identify three compositional groupings for the Stonehenge doleritic monolith and debitage samples and conclude that the majority of them (Group 1 of this paper) can be sourced to the prominent outcrop in the eastern Mynydd Preseli known as Carn Goedog. We also offer potential sources (with one exception) for those Stonehenge dolerites which appear not to relate to Carn Goedog.

                  Seven examples from the Chalk of England illustrate the importance of geoconservation to advances in understanding Upper Cretaceous Chalk geology and wider studies relevant to society including construction projects, groundwater investigations and environmental change. Two field sections are now lost to landfill (Asham, Lewes and Downend, Portsdown) and five are extant (Southerham Grey Pit, Lewes, South Lodge Pit Taplow, Berkshire, Peacehaven Cliffs and Eastbourne Cliffs, Sussex). Each of these field sections shows the range of geology that needs to be considered in any conservation strategy. Continued access to such coastal and inland field sections is vital so that new ideas and techniques can be tested and re-measuring and re-sampling can take place.The need for field sections has, and continues to be, challenged and there is a view that borehole cores can provide sufficient reference material to replace field sections. The inadequacies of a borehole alternative to field sections are illustrated with examples from Southerham Grey Pit, Lewes and Downend Quarry, Portsdown, Hampshire. These two sites also illustrate that a trench cut to replace a quarry face will not guarantee exposure of an equivalent geology. There are wider implications for society as field sections are essential for interpreting the geology beneath London and Stonehenge for tunnels and aquifer studies. Local field sections are also part of new initiatives, through the Lewes Railway Land Wildlife Trust, to widen understanding of and integrate geosciences with other natural sciences through environmental education to better inform decisions on environmental issues.

A series of previously unrecognized features were identified: a pit-arc or cove below a barrow on the west side of King Barrow Ridge, a square-shaped feature surrounded by pits on the east side of Stonehenge Bottom, and a linear ditch on the same solstical axis, and parallel to, the southern section of the Stonehenge Avenue.

                  The source of the Stonehenge bluestones was first determined in the early 1920s by H.H. Thomas who was an officer with the Geological Survey of England and Wales. He determined that the so-called ‚Äòspotted dolerites‚Äô could be petrographically matched to a small number of outcrops in the Mynydd Preseli district in south-west Wales. The bluestones, however, comprise a number of additional lithologies, including rhyolite and ‚Äòcalcareous ash‚Äô, as well as various sandstones. Thomas was convinced that the volcanic lithologies in the bluestone assemblage were all sourced from a small area at the eastern end of the Mynydd Preseli, with the rhyolites originating from the prominent outcrop known as Carn Alw. Recently, provenancing of these rhyolites to Carn Alw has been questioned on the evidence of whole-rock geochemistry. This raised concerns over the original petrographical attribution. Accordingly a re-investigation was undertaken of the rhyolite petrography by re-examining the original specimens used by Thomas. Three of the original four thin sections studied by Thomas were re-examined, along with a newly made thin section from the fourth of Thomas' rock samples as the original thin section could not be located. The new petrographical evidence demonstrates convincingly that the two pairs of thin sections from the Preseli and Stonehenge as examined by Thomas do not match despite his contention and argues strongly that Carn Alw is not the source of the Stonehenge rhyolites which Thomas described. This reinforces the geochemical evidence presented recently and supports the contention that Craig Rhos-y-felin, to the north of Mynydd Preseli, is an important source of rhyolitic debris in the Stonehenge Landscape. Nevertheless, there remain uncertainties over the provenance of other Stonehenge rhyolites (and dacites), including four of the orthostats themselves.

                    A new sequence of Holocene landscape change has been discovered through an investigation of sediment sequences, palaeosols, pollen and molluscan data discovered during the Stonehenge Riverside Project. The early post-glacial vegetational succession in the Avon valley at Durrington Walls was apparently slow and partial, with intermittent woodland modification and the opening-up of this landscape in the later Mesolithic and earlier Neolithic, though a strong element of pine lingered into the third millennium

This was reflected in episodic increases in channel sedimentation and tree and shrub clearance, leading to a more open downland, with greater indications of anthropogenic activity, and an increasingly wet floodplain with sedges and alder along the river's edge. Nonetheless, a localized woodland cover remained in the vicinity of Durrington Walls throughout the third and second millennia

It is constructed on cosmological principles based on a solar alignment, reflecting ‚Äúa distinctive idea of time, which revolved around the cyclical movements of sun, moon, and stars across the heavens, as indicators of the passing seasons‚Äù (Fagan 1998:160). This article sketches mainstream archaeological interpretations of Stonehenge, then contrasts them with the popular narrative of its Druidic origin and purpose, which emerged in the seventeenth century. Modern Druids have negotiated the right to perform rituals at Stonehenge with English Heritage, the custodial body with responsibility for the monument, and Druidry has been recognised as a religion in the United Kingdom in 2010 (Beckford 2010). Modern Druidry, an ‚Äúinvented tradition,‚Äù conflicts with academic archaeology in its claims regarding Stonehenge (Chippindale 1986:38‚Äì58). Postmodern archaeological theories, which privilege ‚Äúpopular folk archaeology‚Äù (Holtorf 2005b:11), are more open to vernacular interpretations of artifacts and sites. These perspectives are broadly compatible with the deregulated religio-spiritual marketplace of the twenty-first century, which is characterized by a plethora of new religions and a pluralistic model of religious truth.1",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84859842191,crossref-doi

                  The source of the bluestone component found in the Stonehenge landscape has long been the subject of great interest and considerable debate. The bluestones are a mix of lithologies, the standing orthostats being predominantly dolerites, variably ‚Äòspotted‚Äô, with only four of them being of dacitic and rhyolitic composition and the Altar Stone being sandstone. However in the 1920s the spotted dolerites were sourced to outcrops which comprise tors in the summit regions of the Mynydd Preseli in north Pembrokeshire, west Wales. There were also speculations about the possible sources of the dacitic and rhyolitic components, ideas which were elaborated on in the early 1990s when the original petrological provenancing was supplemented by whole-rock geochemical analysis. Most recently, new petrographical investigations have been combined with zircon geochemical data to determine the possible source of one type of rhyolite, the so-called ‚Äòrhyolite with fabric‚Äô, found abundantly as d√©bitage in the Stonehenge landscape (but not composing the four orthostats) to outcrops in the vicinity of Pont Saeson, especially a large craggy outcrop called Craig Rhos-y-felin, located in low ground to the north of the Mynydd Preseli. In order to test this provenance whole-rock geochemical analysis has been undertaken on samples of d√©bitage from the Stonehenge landscape and from the Pont Saeson area, including Craig Rhos-y-felin. These data are then compared with other new and existing geochemical data for dacitic and rhyolitic lithologies recovered from the Stonehenge landscape, including the four orthostats, as well as geochemical data from outcrops of the same lithologies from the two main volcanic horizons exposed across north Pembrokeshire, namely the Fishguard Volcanic Group and the Sealyham Volcanic Formation, both of Ordovician age. This study concludes that previous, 20th century, attributions of provenance to a number of dacitic and rhyolitic outcrops in the north Pembrokeshire have been in error whilst the new data for the Pont Saeson rhyolite accords well with elemental contents recorded in the ‚Äòrhyolite with fabric‚Äô lithology from the Stonehenge landscape d√©bitage. This study therefore endorses the proposal that the Pont Saeson area is indeed the source of the ‚Äòrhyolite with fabric‚Äô lithology recovered from numerous sites in the Stonehenge landscape, and is the only reliable provenance for any of the dacitic and rhyolitic bluestone material collected to date. It also serves to endorse the use of zircon chemistry as a provenancing tool in archaeopetrological investigations.

                    Slow subsidence and tectonic quiescence along the New York Promontory margin of Laurentia mean that the carbonate-dominated Tribes Hill and overlying Rochdale formations serve as proxies for the magnitude and timing of Tremadocian eustatic changes. Both formations are unconformity-bound, deepening‚Äìshoaling, depositional sequences that double in thickness from the craton into the parautochthonous, western Appalachian Mountains. A consistent, ‚Äòlayer cake‚Äô succession of member-level units of the formations persists through this region. The Tribes Hill Formation (late early Tremadocian, late Skullrockian, late Fauna B‚Äì
                    Rossodus manitouensis
                    Chron) unconformably overlies the terminal Cambrian Little Falls Formation as the lowest Ordovician unit on the New York Promontory. It was deposited during the strong early Tremadocian, or Stonehenge, transgression that inundated Laurentia, brought dysoxic/anoxic (d/a) slope water onto the shelf and led to deposition of the Schaghticoke d/a interval (black mudstone and ‚Äòribbon limestone‚Äô) on the Laurentian continental slope. The uniform lithofacies succession of the Tribes Hill includes a lower sand-rich member; a middle, dark grey to black mudstone that records d/a in eastern exposures; and an upper, shoaling-up carbonate highstand facies. A widespread (12000+ km
                    2
                    ) thrombolitic interval in the highstand carbonate suggests the New York Promontory was rimmed by thrombolites during deposition of the Tribes Hill. Offlap and erosion of the Tribes Hill was followed by the relatively feeble sea-level rise of the Rochdale transgression (new) in Laurentia, and deposition of the Rochdale Formation. The Rochdale transgression, correlated with the
                    Kierograptus
                    Drowning Interval in Baltica, marks a eustatic rise. The Rochdale Formation represents a short Early Ordovician interval (early late Tremadocian, middle‚Äìlate Stairsian,
                    Macerodus dianae
                    Chron). It correlates with a depositional sequence that forms the middle Boat Harbour Formation in west Newfoundland and with the Rte 299 d/a interval on the east Laurentian slope. The Rochdale has a lower carbonate with abundant quartz silt (Comstock Member, new) and an upper, thrombolitic (Hawk Member, new) high-stand facies. Tribes Hill and Rochdale faunas are mollusc-rich, generally trilobite-poor, and have low diversity, Laurentian faunal province conodonts.

                  The source of the bluestones at Stonehenge has long been debated, and while there is general consensus that the so-called spotted dolerites are derived from a relatively small number of outcrops exposed in the highest parts of Mynydd Preseli, in southwest Wales the source of the rhyolitic component has attracted relatively little detailed attention. This is largely because unlike the uniqueness of the spots in the coarser grained doleritic rocks, the rhyolites are fine-grained in character and lack any obvious distinctiveness, especially in hand specimen. This makes their provenancing difficult. A recent study, however, suggested that there was a close lithological similarity between the informally-termed ‚Äòrhyolite with fabric‚Äô bluestone component and rhyolitic rocks from the Ordovician Fishguard Volcanic Group exposed in the Pont Saeson area of north Pembrokeshire. This study aims to see if the chemistry of zircons, which are present in both sets of samples, could be used to support the petrographical association. Analyses for certain high field strength elements (including the rare earth elements) obtained by LA-ICP-MS showed that indeed the analyses were nearly identical when compared using a range of statistical approaches, including similarity coefficients, statistical distance, and principal component analysis, while showing clear differences to sample sets which had no reason to be correlated with the Pont Saeson samples. There are two important conclusions arising from this study. Firstly, the identification of the Pont Saeson source of the ‚Äòrhyolite with fabric‚Äô bluestone from outcrops in low ground to the north of the Mynydd Preseli will without doubt lead to fresh debates about the mechanisms of transport of this component of the bluestones to the Stonehenge site. Secondly, the chemistry of zircons may well prove to have a wider application in the provenancing of fine-grained rhyolitic rocks which have an archaeological context.

Long-held notions that the skeleton was extended are dispelled; instead, the grave assemblage is reconstructed around the universal crouched inhumation rite of the period, giving rise to important new implications.

Experiencing Hodgson at work led me to re-examine how archaeologists think about visuality, particularly in criticism of the male gaze. Ideas of the gaze have significantly influenced the directions taken in studies of landscape and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) over the last 15 years. In this article I expand on and develop theoretical debate surrounding the gaze, using Hodgson's practice to illustrate my argument. I argue for a renewed critique of the politics of vision and cartographic method that assimilates recent theoretical developments. I review accounts of the gaze, and discuss recent theories of knowledge as applied to mapping and GIS. I suggest that new theories have the potential to move the gaze critique towards further exploration of the contextual complexities of visualities.

                  This paper describes a technique for the alignment of crystal radiators used to produce high energy, linearly polarized photons via coherent bremsstrahlung scattering at electron beam facilities. In these experiments the crystal is mounted on a goniometer which is used to adjust its orientation relative to the electron beam. The angles and equations which relate the crystal lattice, goniometer and electron beam direction are presented here, and the method of alignment is illustrated with data taken at MAMI (the Mainz microtron). A practical guide to setting up a coherent bremsstrahlung facility and installing new crystals using this technique is also included.

What a useful precedent. I hope I am not over self-indulgent to the extent of being too autobiographical, but the subject does relate to my personal experience of the practice of architectural history in the conservation of historic buildings. The history of building conservation is now developing its own quite substantial literature to which this is a small contribution. To some extent this lecture is as much about bureaucracy as about architecture, for much of my life has been spent as an official in the public service. But, so that the lecture is properly historical, most of what I will talk about happened before I was involved.One major difference between the British and American Societies of Architectural Historians is that the American Society has always involved itself in building preservation issues, whereas the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain does not. This recognizes the different circumstances in each country. In Great Britain we have many amenity societies directed to conservation matters; most of us will belong to one or more of them and they are centres of quite extraordinary expertise. But in view of what I will say later, it is notable that in an account of a meeting in March 1941 in Washington, reported in the first volume of the American Society‚Äôs journal, Henry-Russell Hitchcock commented on the merits of the Historic American Buildings Survey, but added that selections by local groups often lacked historical perspective and ignored anything later than the Greek Revival; that there was excessive preservation of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century houses in New England without regard to architectural merit; and that primary monuments of modern architectural history were wantonly destroyed. As concerns the latter, he cited, among others, Richardson‚Äôs Marshall Field Warehouse, and a threat to Wright‚Äôs Robie House. The representative of the National Parks Service said that 1870 was about the date limit for a building to be regarded as of interest, though the Vanderbilt House of 1895 had recently been acquired, and that attention was also being paid to groups of buildings.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77951725513,crossref-doi

                    The following paper is the first published account of an excavation that took place at Stonehenge during April 2008. As this was the first excavation to take place within the stone circle for some forty years, the excavation has attracted an uncommon degree of interest, hence its publication in the

                    as an interim account of work in progress, in the form of an edited transcript of a paper first given at the Ordinary Meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 9 October 2008. The paper explains that the 2008 excavation set out to date the construction of the Double Bluestone Circle at Stonehenge and to chart the subsequent history of the bluestones and their use at the monument. Evidence is presented for a provisional working date of around 2300

                    for the construction of the Double Bluestone Circle, while it is argued that the history of the site is far more complex than has been allowed for in existing interpretations, with a multiplicity of overlapping and intercutting (though not continuous) events, including substantial late Roman, medieval and early modern activity. The excavated material, and the evidence from the surviving stones, supports the suggestion that bluestones were brought to the site because of their perceived special qualities, perhaps for their supposed healing properties, and that some knowledge of those qualities remained current in later times with the result that in excess of two-thirds of the original bluestone volume has now disappeared.

                  The patterns of gorse pod production, the phenology of Exapion ulicis and its impact on gorse seed production were assessed in a field study conducted at two sites over 20 months in Tasmania, Australia. The production of gorse pods varied considerably between the two sites as did the impact of E. ulicis on mature gorse seed production. At Stonehenge, a site in Tasmania‚Äôs eastern midlands, green pods were produced in spring and summer and black pods were produced in late spring, summer and early autumn, the timing of which was well synchronised with E. ulicis seed feeding activity. At Lymington, a coastal site in southern Tasmania, both green and black pods were produced almost all year, the timing of which was not well synchronised with E. ulicis seed feeding activity. As a result, the average percentage of mature seeds that were damaged by E. ulicis was 2.7 times higher at Stonehenge (45.5%) than at Lymington (16.7%). These levels of seed destruction were much lower than the levels (i.e. 75‚Äì85%) that were considered necessary by previous workers to cause a decline in gorse densities. The results show that additional agents are needed to act in combination with E. ulicis and reduce seed production further if seed feeding biological control agents are to have an impact on plant densities in Tasmanian gorse populations.

               People are fascinated by antiquity: How did humanity come to be? What does the cave art of the Upper Paleolithic mean? How did ancient Egyptians build the pyramids? What was the purpose of Stonehenge? Public interest generates an appetite for solutions to these perceived mysteries and the demand for solutions creates a ready supply of researchers and writers ready to provide them, commonly by proposing highly speculative interpretations of actual data and, in the extreme, through the agency of outright fraud. Examples of archaeological frauds perpetrated in the name of religion (the Cardiff Giant) and science (Piltdown Man and the Fujimura web of hoaxes related to Paleolithic archaeology in Japan) are discussed here. Beyond mere fraud, pseudoarchaeology also involves the misinterpretation and misrepresentation of archaeological data to concoct a past that some feel is more satisfying, a past populated by greatly advanced, super-civilizations in deep time, lost continents, and even technology-proselytizing extraterrestrial visitors to our planet in antiquity. Such extreme scenarios have in common the fact that archaeological evidence lends no support to them. If, as author L. P. Hartley is correct in his characterization of the past as a foreign country, then archaeology provides our only viable passport and the extraordinary fables concocted by the pseudoarchaeologists must be rejected for the stories that only a scientific investigation of the past can provide.

A current campaign of research, being waged by probably the strongest archaeological team ever assembled, is focused not just on the monument, but on its landscape, its hinterland and the monuments within it. The campaign is still in progress, but the story so far is well worth reporting. Revisiting records of 100 years ago the authors demonstrate that the ambiguous dating of the trilithons, the grand centrepiece of Stonehenge, was based on samples taken from the wrong context, and can now be settled at 2600-2400 cal BC. This means that the trilithons are contemporary with Durrington Walls, near neighbour and Britain's largest henge monument. These two monuments, different but complementary, now predate the earliest Beaker burials in Britain ‚Äì including the famous Amesbury Archer and Boscombe Bowmen, but may already have been receiving Beaker pottery. All this contributes to a new vision of massive monumental development in a period of high European intellectual mobility‚Ä¶.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34848879222,crossref-doi

Extending this insight to recent findings in archaeoastronomy, this article treats the sarsen monument at Stonehenge as one among a number of monuments with lunar‚Äìsolar alignments which privileged night over day, winter over summer, dark moon over full. The aim of the monument builders was to juxtapose, replicate and reverse certain key horizon properties of the sun and the moon, apparently with the intention of investing the sun with the moon's former religious significance. This model is consistent with both current archaeological interpretations of burial practices associated with the monument, and with recent anthropological modelling of hunter-gatherer cultural origins.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34347314393,crossref-doi

                  In the 1720s the antiquary and Newtonian scholar Dr. William Stukeley (1687‚Äì1765) described his friend Isaac Newton as ‚Äòthe Great Restorer of True Philosophy‚Äô. Newton himself in his posthumously published Observations upon the prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John (1733) predicted that the imminent fulfilment of Scripture prophecy would see ‚Äòa recovery and re-establishment of the long-lost truth‚Äô. In this paper I examine the background to Newton‚Äôs interest in ancient philosophy and theology, and how it related to modern natural philosophical discovery. I look at the way in which the idea of a ‚Äòlong-lost truth‚Äô interested others within Newton‚Äôs immediate circle, and in particular how it was carried forward by Stukeley‚Äôs researches into ancient British antiquities. I show how an interest in and respect for ancient philosophical knowledge remained strong within the first half of the eighteenth century.

                    Most state-of-the-art commercial storage virtualization systems focus only on one particular storage attribute, capacity. This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a
                    multi-dimensional storage virtualization
                    system called Stonehenge, which is able to virtualize a cluster-based physical storage system along multiple dimensions, including bandwidth, capacity, and latency. As a result, Stonehenge is able to multiplex multiple virtual disks, each with a distinct bandwidth, capacity, and latency attribute, on a single physical storage system as if they are separate physical disks. A key enabling technology for Stonehenge is an efficiency-aware real-time disk scheduling algorithm called dual-queue disk scheduling, which maximizes disk utilization efficiency while providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. To optimize disk utilization efficiency, Stonehenge exploits run-time measurements extensively, for admission control, computing latency-derived bandwidth requirement, and predicting disk service time.

                  Great monumental places‚ÄîPetra, Giza, Angkor, Stonehenge, Tikal, Macchu Picchu, Rapa Nui, to name a few‚Äîare links to our cultural past. They evoke a sense of wonderment for their aesthetic fascination if not for their seeming permanence over both cultural and physical landscapes. However, as with natural landforms, human constructs are subject to weathering and erosion. Indeed, many of our cultural resources suffer from serious deterioration, some natural, some enhanced by human impact. Groups from the United Nations to local civic and tourism assemblies are deeply interested in maintaining and preserving such cultural resources, from simple rock art to great temples. Geomorphologists trained in interacting systems, process and response to thresholds, rates of change over time, and spatial variation of weathering processes and effects are able to offer insight into how deterioration occurs and what can be done to ameliorate the impact.
                  Review of recent literature and case studies presented here demonstrate methodological and theoretical advances that have resulted from the study of cultural stone weathering. Because the stone was carved at a known date to a ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù or zero-datum level, some of the simplest methods (e.g., assessing surface weathering features or measuring surface recession in the field) provide useful data on weathering rates and processes. Such data are difficult or impossible to obtain in ‚Äúnatural‚Äù settings. Cultural stone weathering studies demonstrate the importance of biotic and saline weathering agents and the significance of weathering factors such as exposure (microclimate) and human impact. More sophisticated methods confirm these observations, but also reveal discrepancies between field and laboratory studies. This brings up two important caveats for conservators and geomorphologists. For the conservator, are laboratory and natural setting studies really analogous and useful for assessing stone damage? For the geomorphologist, does cultural stone data have any real relevance to the natural environment? These are questions for future research and debate. In any event, cultural stone weathering studies have been productive for both geomorphologists and conservators. Continued collaboration and communication between the geomorphic, historic preservation, archaeological, and engineering research communities are encouraged.

                    The changing cosmological symbolism incorporated in Phases 1 and 2 at Stonehenge is reviewed in the light of new evidence from patterns of deposition prior to the construction of the bluestone and sarsen stone settings. The early structure of the monument and attendant depositional practices embodied a scheme of radial division, including a symbolic quartering primarily demarcated by solstitial rising and setting points. Through sustained ritual practice, however, the motions of the moon came increasingly to be referenced through deposition, particularly of cremations. This evidence seems to contradict earlier claims of a sudden shift in and around Wessex during the mid-third millennium

                    from a predominantly lunar to a predominantly solar cosmology. It suggests instead that interest in solar and lunar events did not necessarily preclude each other and that over the centuries there was a process of subtle change involving the continual reworking of symbolic schemes emphasizing a sense of ‚Äòtimelessness‚Äô and the unchanging order of the universe.

                  Operations for cataract have been performed for centuries; however, it was not until the late 1940s that the concept of an artificial intraocular lens was developed by Harold Ridley, an ophthalmologist practising in London. The first and epoch-making operation took place at St. Thomas' Hospital, London on 29 November 1949. Ridley implanted about 1000 intraocular lenses over the next few years. The complication rate at first was high but, by trial and error, progress was gradually made. The idea of implanting an artificial lens in the eye of a patient was anathema to large segments of the ophthalmology community and inevitably called forth discourteous reactions, especially from within the academic establishment in Europe and the United States of America.
                  Even in the 1970s, few ophthalmologists gave any thought to Ridley's operation. Recognition finally occurred. He received the highest honour that British scientists can confer when in 1986 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He feels rewarded by the knowledge that sight of natural quality is restored to millions of patients all over the world. One recognition that many felt was long overdue was finally consummated early in the new millennium, when Queen Elizabeth II conferred on him a knighthood.
                  Now 94 years old, he lives with his wife Elisabeth in a thatched seventeenth-century cottage by the banks of the River Wylie in the picturesque village of Stapleford, Wiltshire, not far from Stonehenge.

Faced with a Stonehenge or a Silbury Hill, the evident deployment of large labour forces might naturally lead to thoughts of social √©lites and stratified societies. The task facing archaeologists today, however, is to interpret such monuments not as programmatic products of parallel social processes but as elements in unique and dynamic configurations of social, political and ideological interactions. This is the approach which the present volume seeks to exemplify, taking as its focus the famous site of Cahokia in the Mississippi valley. Cahokia itself is the greatest monument complex of prehistoric North America, marked by 120 mounds spread over an area of 13 square kilometres across the Mississippi river from the modern city of St Louis. During the twelfth century AD this was a settlement with a population estimated to have numbered in the thousands if not tens of thousands. What does such a phenomenon represent in social and political terms?In this book, Thomas Emerson considers not just the monuments of Cahokia themselves but the evidence for ideology and the power relationships which might have supported a hierarchical society, and the mechanisms which may have connected Cahokia with its rural hinterland. The wealth of detailed information available from the sites in and around Cahokia ‚Äî some of them excavated by Emerson himself ‚Äî allows a detailed analysis at a level which is rarely possible in archaeological cases of this kind. Drawing on concepts of individual agency, power and ideology as forces for social change, Emerson interprets the rise of Cahokia as the successful manipulation of ideology by √©lites, an ideology in which the subordinate layers of society are compelled to participate.Emerson's study raises key questions about the rise and fall of complex societies, and the role of ideology and agency in that process. That these questions remain open to debate, the contributions to this review feature amply demonstrate. How hierarchical was Cahokia, how effective was √©lite ideology, and, above all, how can we go about analyzing this kind of question from the archaeological evidence? The results have a bearing on archaeological interpretation at the very broadest level.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/1842545641,crossref-doi

                  Presence in virtual environments can be defined as the participant's feeling or sense of ‚Äúbeing there‚Äù in the virtual environment. Two factors which may influence the level of presence experienced by a participant within a virtual environment are the display update rate and the type of input device used for navigating within the virtual environment. This paper presents the results of a study examining the relationship between two types of input device and three display update rates on the user's sense of presence within a virtual environment. In the experiment, eight subjects used either a joystick or a SpaceBall to navigate through a virtual representation of Stonehenge at update rates of 10, 15, and 20Hz. The task was to search for an object hidden within the virtual environment. It was found that although the type of input device had no effect on the user's sense of presence, an update rate of at least 15Hz was the critical value for the user feeling present in the virtual environment. Implications of the results for the design of virtual environments and for creating a sense of presence within virtual environments are discussed.

                    The richly textured paper on Stonehenge by Mike Parker Pearson & Ramilisonina (1998) develops exciting new ways of looking at Stonehenge and other stone monuments, drawing on analogies from Madagascar and elsewhere to elaborate the importance of ancestors in kinship-based societies. The presentation of practices and beliefs related to ancestors in parts of Madagascar is particularly powerful. Their Neolithic model gains extra credence by being applied not only to Stonehenge but also to the Avebury complex. In the latter case, I find their suggestion of a parallelism in layout between Avebury and the West Kennet Avenue on the one hand and West Kennet palisade enclosure 2 and Outer Radial Ditch 1 plus Structure 4 on the other, very convincing. That relationship may just have been reinforced by the recognition this year by RCHME on aerial photographs (Bob Bewley pers. comm.) of
                    another
                    outer radial ditch leading from Palisade Enclosure 2 to

                  Geological interest in Stonehenge includes not only the main structural components of the monument but also large amounts of stone either used to assist construction, or present as waste from stone-working, or as artefacts left at the site. One suite of rocks, including Chilmark Ragstone, Upper Greensand sandstone and two types of sarsen, can be assembled from localities in Wiltshire, but not without transporting sarsen blocks weighing up to 50 tonnes over a distance of some 40 km. In contrast, the ‚Äòbluestones‚Äô, including dolerites, rhyolites, volcanic ashes and sandstones, originated in southwest Wales, with the bulk of the material coming from a small area in the eastern Preseli Hills, a distance of approximately 400 km from Stonehenge. The lack of evidence for Quaternary glaciation in south Wiltshire means that glacial transport cannot explain the occurrence of this Welsh material on Salisbury Plain. It must therefore have been brought there by the builders of Stonehenge. A brief review of the technical achievements and artistic traditions of the later Neolithic period and the early Bronze Age, reveals the building of Stonehenge as an undertaking consistent with the rich cultural context of these times.

My aim is to show that the museum has always been a site of otherness that expresses a utopic practice that comes to shape a vision of the ordering of the social. Having made this argument in relation to the ‚Äòclassical‚Äô museum, I then turn to the space of the museum without walls and suggest that it is also heterotopic but, in relation to particular sites, characterized by many different utopics that make the meaning of such a space uncertain, ambivalent and ultimately not representable in any unified way. To illustrate this I use the example of Stonehenge as a museum without walls. It is an impossible, unrepre-sentable space but one that also means a great deal to many different groups of people. Stonehenge is imbued with a myriad of different utopics all of which express different visions of the ordering of the social that are often expressed through forms of resistance to ways in which society, through the prism of such a site, is seen to be currently ordered.What monstrous place is this?

                    (c.
                    3000‚Äì1500 BC) monuments. It is dominated by large upright sarsen stones, some of which are joined by lintels. While these stones are of relatively local derivation, some of the stone settings, termed bluestones, are composed of igneous and minor sedimentary rocks which are foreign to the solid geology of Salisbury Plain and must have been transported to their present location. Following the proposal of an origin in south-west Wales, debate has focused on hypotheses of natural transport by glacial processes, or transport by human agency. This paper reports the results of a programme of sampling and chemical analysis of Stonehenge bluestones and proposed source outcrops in Wales
                    .
                  Analysis by X-ray-fluorescence of fifteen monolith samples and twenty-two excavated fragments from Stonehenge indicate that the dolerites originated at three sources in a small area in the eastern Preseli Hills, and that the rhyolite monoliths derive from four sources including northern Preseli and other (unidentified) locations in Pembrokeshire, perhaps on the north Pembrokeshire coast. Rhyolite fragments derive from four outcrops (including only one of the monolith sources) over a distance of at least 10 km within Preseli. The Altar Stone and a sandstone fragment (excavated at Stonehenge) are from two sources within the Palaeozoic of south-west Wales. This variety of source suggests that the monoliths were taken from a glacially-mixed deposit, not carefully selected from an
                    in situ
                    source. We then consider whether prehistoric man collected the bluestones from such a deposit in south Wales or whether glacial action could have transported bluestone boulders onto Salisbury Plain. Glacial erratics deposited in south Dyfed (dolerites chemically identical to Stonehenge dolerite monoliths), near Cardiff, on Flatholm and near Bristol indicate glacial action at least as far as the Avon area. There is an apparent absence of erratics east of here, with the possible exception of the Boles Barrow boulder, which may predate the Stonehenge bluestones by as much as 1000 years, and which derived from the same Preseli source as two of the Stonehenge monoliths. However, 18th-century geological accounts describe intensive agricultural clearance of glacial boulders, including igneous rocks, on Salisbury Plain, and contemporary practice was of burial of such boulders in pits. Such erratics could have been transported as ‚Äòfree boulders‚Äô from ‚Äònunataks‚Äô on the top of an extensive, perhaps Anglian or earlier, glacier some 400,000 years ago or more, leaving no trace of fine glacial material in present river gravels. Erratics may be deposited at the margins of ice-sheets in small groups at irregular intervals and with gaps of several kilometres between individual boulders
                    .
                  ‚ÄòBluestone‚Äô fragments are frequently reported on and near Salisbury Plain in archaeological literature, and include a wide range of rock types from monuments of widely differing types and dates, and pieces not directly associated with archaeological structures. Examination of prehistoric stone monuments in south Wales shows no preference for bluestones in this area. The monoliths at Stonehenge include some structurally poor rock types, now completely eroded above ground. We conclude that the builders of the bluestone structures at Stonehenge utilized a heterogeneous deposit of glacial boulders readily available on Salisbury Plain. Remaining erratics are now seen as small fragments sometimes incorporated in a variety of archaeological sites, while others were destroyed and removed in the 18th century. The bluestones were transported to Salisbury Plain from varied sources in south Wales by a glacier rather than human activity.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0026313597,crossref-doi

                    The Italian resort of Bordighera, on the Riviera close by the French border, still has a little to show from the time, a century ago, when its British population-at least in the winter ‚Äòinvalid season‚Äô- ran to more than
                    3,000
                    and outnumbered the native Italians. The Hotel T. Windsor (‚ÄòT‚Äô stands for tennis; the Bordighera tennis club, founded by the British, is the oldest in Italy) flourishes; prim municipal notices-‚ÄòA polite behaviour will be enjoyable for everybody‚Äô and ‚ÄòFree bathing, clean holidays‚Äô-assert Edwardian proprieties. And tucked away in a side-street among the villas, its pink-washed facade frothing with wisteria, stands the Museo Bicknell, built in 1886 by an English amateur botanist, Clarence Bicknell. His foundation continues as the regional research institute, the Istituto lnternazionale di Studi Liguri. Clarence Bicknell
                    (1842-1918)
                    appears in none of the histories
                    of
                    archaeology, but his work deserves to be remembered. His study of the bronze age rockengravings of Mont BCgo, in the Maritime Alps above Bordighera, was the first adequate work on an Alpine rock-art tradition, and the forerunner of the astonishing discoveries over the last
                    30
                    years in Valcamonica (Anati, 1961; 1980), at Sion (Gallay, 1972) and now in the Aosta valley (Daniel,
                    1983).
                    Bicknell's life and work, beyond its intrinsic interest, is an illuminating case-study in the history of the discipline, during that crucial late 19thcentury period when antiquarianism was everywhere giving way
                    to
                    the new science-based archaeology. Finally, Bicknell-though not in the major league with Buckland or Petrie-in his quiet way deserves a place in the gallery of archaeological characters.

                    Like many researchers since, William Stukeley in the mid-eighteenth century wondered why the site of Stonehenge had been selected for the Britons' most sublime temple. It was chosen, he decided, according to the ancient notion of placing temples 'in clean and distinct areas, distant from profane buildings and traffic' (Stukeley, 1740, 11) (Pl. xxii
                    a
                    ). Two hundred years on, Stonehenge is set about with traffic, busy main roads running past on both north and south sides, and profane buildings have appeared‚Äîthe Larkhill military complex on the northern skyline, and the Stonehenge car-park and visitors' facilities close by on the north-west.
                  For several centuries now, Stonehenge has been among the most visited of British ancient monuments. Records of tourist day-trips from Salisbury via Old Sarum (still a favourite outing) go back more than 400 years (Folkerzheimer, 1562), and Stukeley (1740, 5) talked of its 'infinite number of daily visitants'.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0021022153,crossref-doi

Detailed recording of find provenances from both these and the Heelstone ditches permitted a fuller understanding of the erosion and filling processes. In 1979, part of a pit that had held a previously unknown standing stone was excavated. A geophysical survey of the Avenue suggests that further pits may be present along its course. A unique deposit of prehistoric stoneworking debitage was sectioned in 1980. It is suggested that this debitage, representing the opportunistic use of megalith shaping debris, accumulated within a structure inhabited at the time the major stone monument was being erected.

In brief, Hoyle proposes that the extant features of Stonehenge I provide the necessary means systematically to observe the sun and moon and to keep track of the nodes of the lunar orbit. This would provide sufficient information to allow eclipses of the moon to be predicted. He also proposes that by the time of Stonehenge III this method was superseded by the use of the Saros cycle of 18 years 11 days to predict eclipses. This last method almost certainly implies that written records of events at full moon were kept.

Of these, 93 are in Wiltshire, 57 being within ten km of Stonehenge, and 36 within five km of that monument, which evidently acted as a magnet in attracting major barrow cemeteries to its vicinity.The normal disc-barrow is of the ‚ÄòWessex culture‚Äô of the Early Bronze Age. The rite is nearly always cremation, but a very few possible instances of primary inhumation need further investigation. The grave-goods are usually necklaces of beads (amber, shale, faience, in four instances all together), in three instances with amber space-plates; bronze awls (pointed at one end and flat at the other which probably went into a handle); and small two-edged bronze knives. Occasionally the cremation is in an urn or with an ‚ÄòAldbourne‚Äô or other cup. The frequency of beads, and the absence of warrior equipment such as ‚ÄòWessex‚Äô bronze daggers, has until now led to the conclusion that they were the places of interment of females.Since 1953 seven disc-barrows have been scientifically excavated but final reports are still awaited. The primary cremation from one of the mounds of the oval twin barrow Milton Lilbourne I was probably female. The primary cremation from the central mound of Collingbourne Kingston 18 could not be sexed; but two cremations from a large pit beneath the eccentric mound of the same barrow were identified as probably and possibly adult male. Cremations from the other sites could not be sexed. These meagre results suggest that the central or other primary mounds of disc-barrows were for females but the eccentric mounds may have been for either sex. The sexing of more cremations is urgently needed.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84976011496,crossref-doi

As more of his constructions are unravelled, we obtain an increasing appreciation of his attainments. Undoubtedly he also observed the heavenly bodies and used them to tell the time of day or night and to tell the day of the year. To take geometry first, let us look at the various shapes which, in his hands, a ring of stone could take. To understand these rings fully it is necessary to appreciate that he used extensively a very precise unit of length‚Äîthe megalithic yard (MY). The exact length of this unit has become known to us by an examination of simple circles and flattened circles. When the author produced the first batch of circle diameters there was no universally accepted statistical analysis for the determination of the reliability of a quantum such as the suggested value for the megalithic yard. Then Broadbent produced two papers providing exactly the methods required to find, from a set of measurements, the most probable value of the quantum and the probability level at which it could be accepted [1,2]. This last is very important because Hammersley had shown that almost any random set of (say) diameters will yield an apparent unit of some sort.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958434662,crossref-doi

England in the and millennium B.C. Either the people were not just primitive farmers or these proposals must be substantially in error. It is not the purpose of this paper to attempt a decision between these alternatives but to explain the nature of the astronomical arguments in more detail than has been done heretofore. My hope is that with a moderate effort it will be possible for the reader to rework the calculations on which the astronomical suggestions have been based; for only when archaeologists and astronomers have understood each other's arguments can we expect to resolve this intriguing dilemma. At several places in the discussion I shall quote the solution of mathematical problems, thereby permitting the whole discussion to be confined to simple trigonometry.

                    The astronomical significance of Stone- henge has been the subject of intermittent debate and speculation ever since 1740, when Stukeley [I] first observed that the axis of the sarsen structure and of the Avenue pointed at least approximately to the sunrise at the summer solstice. Apart from Sir Norman Lockyer [z], however, few professional astronomers concerned themselves with this question, until the appearance in,
                    Nature
                    of the two articles by Gerald S. Hawkins, Professor of Astronomy at Boston University, in 1963 and 1964 [3]. The first of these claimed the discovery of a number of additional alignments of astronomical significance, marked by pairs of stones and other features of the site; and the second suggested that the Aubrey Holes had been used as a neolithic 'computer' for the prediction of movements of the moon and of eclipses. Subsequently these theories received much wider publicity, in Britain as well as in the United States, through a CBS television programme,
                    The Mystery of Stonehenge,
                    which provided a superb example of partiality and tendentiousness in the presentation of an academic controversy.
                  
                    Professor Hawkins has now elaborated his ideas in a book whose title,
                    Stonehenge Decoded
                    , leaves no doubt of his confidence in the rightness of his conclusions-a confidence explicity echoed in his text. 'There can be no doubt that Stonehenge was an observatory; the impartial mathematics of probability and the celestial sphere are on my side' (p. vii). 'I think I have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that the monument was deliberately, accurately, skilfully oriented to the sun and the moon' (pp. 146-7). 'I think I have put forward the best theory to account for the otherwise unexplained holes' (p. 147). 'I think there is little else in these areas that can be discovered at Stonehenge'(p. 147).

                    The author explains how a potsherd or stone, when carelessly thrown away, will gradually sink owing to the action of earth worms, through the earthy top-soil till it reaches an impermeable layer, so that where, as here, the soil is shallow a layer is formed containing objects of all periods. Such a statement made in the 1920‚Äôs was laughed at. Further, he goes on to say (p. 168) : ‚ÄòThe one thing about Stonehenge upon which everyone is agreed is that it is primarily a ‚Äútemple,‚Äù a structure in which it was possible for man to establish contact and communication with extra-mundane forces or beings‚Äô. No one in the nineteen-twenties could have made such a statement and survived. Abercromby said it in his book (
                    Bronze Age Pottery
                    , 1912), and his chapter on Stonehenge is still well worth reading, but it is never quoted or referred to. It was Abercromby, not the present reviewer, who first pointed out the importance of the south-westem end of the axis. The only obvious error noticed (p. 195) is the statement that Colonel Hawley was Director of the Society of Antiquaries. However, this slight error is amply made up for by the forty photographs, all but six of which reveal some feature never before published and probably not even photographed; one of them (plate II : Stonehenge from the north) has an artistic quality that no other photograph I can recall has ever had. The effect of light and shade is most beautiful.

                    Last summer an archaeologist, Mr R. J. C. Atkinson, taking photographs at Stonehenge, made a most remarkable discovery. He was preparing to photograph a name carved on the inward-facing (northwest) face of Stone 53, one of the Great Horseshoe Trilithons; for this purpose he had remained there after 5 o‚Äôclock on July 10th, waiting for the sun to move round and shine on it. Looking not directly at the stone itself but at the image on the glass of his reflex camera, he suddenly saw the dark outline of what appeared to be a dagger, and beside it that of an axe. The carvings were deeply cut and the edges smoothened by the erosive action of more than thirty centuries of British weather (P
                    LATE I
                    ). Closer inspection revealed several more axes and some other markings, all probably artificial but now too much weathered for decipherment. Two days later a ten-year-old schoolboy, David Booth, found an axe on the outer face of Stone 4, one of the stones of the Outer Circle, and subsequent search revealed ten more axes on the same face (P
                    LATES II, VI A
                    ). Later still, while engaged in making casts of the axes already discovered, Mr R. S. Newall has found many more, bringing the total for Stone 53 up to 12 and for Stone 4 to 25, including on the latter one exceptionally large axe measuring 14 inches in length and 10¬Ω inches across the splayed cutting edge. He has also verified three axes like the others near the bottom left-hand corner of the outer face of Stone 3 (P
                    LATE III B
                    ).

                    Historia Britonum
                    of Nennius and a collection of pedigrees of ruling houses of the Welsh Dark Ages; a variety of other classical and Celtic material was laid under contribution for embellishments, but there was certainly nothing that could be connected, even indirectly, with any source earlier than that of the classical writers' accounts of the Roman conquest and occupation of Britain. Geoffrey's prehistory is in fact completely bogus, and while it may sometimes incorporate interesting fragments of early medieval history or legend, it bears no relation whatsoever to the period it professes to chronicle.

The common, first-sight belief that the barrows and the monument represent a necropolis encircling its sanctuary has been opposed on the ground of the irregular grouping and distances of the barrows. It may, however, be suggested in passing that if the Plain was parcelled out among clans or families into territories nearer and further and of varying sizes, and if the known custom obtained of burying the important dead where they had lived, this irregularity is explicable.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971730899,crossref-doi

In conclusion it is said ‚Äòthat Stonehenge was built after the Aubrey circle is certain‚Äô. There is, however, evidence that leads to a different theory, and this being so, it is desirable that it should be stated; otherwise it might appear that those interested agreed with the conclusion, or at least had no evidence to the contrary. A fact used to support the two-date theory is that the end of the ditch overlaps the avenue. There is general agreement that this ditch was levelled and obliterated on the surface in order that it should not obstruct the avenue. The critical point is when this filling-up took place. According to the two-date theory it was only when the later Stonehenge. was built, and therefore a long time after the ditch was first dug. But if the evidence from the excavation is carefully examined it becomes plain that this part of the ditch must have been refilled almost immediately after it was made.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971803772,crossref-doi

The details shown were, however, disappointing, for when the south-east trench of the avenue appeared it presented an insignificant-looking, angular section in the bank about 18 in. deep and 3 ft. wide in top measurement, the apex of the angle cutting a groove in the solid chalk below. Where the extremity of the groove approached the ditch it ended at 8 in. from the side, leaving a ridge of undisturbed chalk, and indicating that the ditch was of earlier construction. The contents of the ditch showed that there had been no attempt to carry the avenue across it, nor was there any sign of it on the opposite side. The avenue bank was barely discernible and it is rather doubtful if it came quite to the edge of the ditch. It gave the impression that when making it the builders allowed their work to fade out as they approached the edge. The ditch continued an unaltered course independently of the proximity of the avenue.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33745552931,crossref-doi

A fourth excavation in continuation of the third was begun immediately afterwards and carried 26 ft. to the west. It was made 2 ft. wider, as the ditch here appeared to have been wider and deeper, but except for this there was no appreciable difference from former sections. The upper soil had been much disturbed by rabbits or persons digging them out, the burrows being occasionally found to be 4 ft. deep. The upper layer of humus, and the rubble layer beneath it, contained chips of the building of Stonehenge to the number of 570, but none was found lower than the junction with the silt. With the chips were four small worn pieces of Bronze Age pottery, 10 of the Roman Period, a small quartzite maul, about 60 animal bone fragments, and the greater part of a human ulna bone.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973976181,crossref-doi

                    The article on Stonehenge that appeared in the January number of the
                    Nineteenth Century
                    demands consideration. The writer, Mr. E. Herbert Stone, after re-stating and defending Sir Norman Lockyer's views, which I shall presently explain, notices ‚Äòsome criticisms‚Äô, including those of Mr. Arthur Hinks and my own. ‚ÄòRice Holmes‚Äô, he says, ‚Äòsets forth the old arguments in favour of the Bronze Age theory, many of which are fallacious ‚Ä¶ the deservedly high position occupied by Mr. Rice Holmes in the literary world has led some archaeologists, who have not understood the technicalities of the subject, to accept his opinions without question‚Äô.

These formed a group of four monoliths, numbered from west to east, 29, 30, 1, and 2. They carried lintels, survivors of the series which once capped the stones of the outer circle. Nos. 1 and 2 had moved out of position, leaning badly outwards, and had drawn with them the three lintels from their seatings to the danger of these and themselves. They would have fallen long ago had they not been supported by props which were beginning to decay, so it was necessary to attend to them at once.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33745555186,crossref-doi
